comparometer
============

Big numbers means nothing to you? The same for me. The comparameter tries to be the solution to this problem.

Test it at http://crispamares.github.com/comparometer/

The code needed to generate this is just:

    compare(10000, $("div.chart"), "0AgLTtFH_1iwUdFNHeFVzRVZSS2Y2R0ZHeDByTjBXNXc");

The fisrt parameter is the big number, the second one is the DOM element used as container and the last one is the key of an already published google docs spreadsheet like this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgLTtFH_1iwUdFNHeFVzRVZSS2Y2R0ZHeDByTjBXNXc#gid=0
